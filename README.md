## What is the project about?

This repository contains some of the AI projects I have done. The projects are written in Python and are based on the following topics:

- Reinforcement Learning
- Machine Learning

This project is basic game AI. Using the google dinosaur game as an example, I have implemented a simple AI to play the game. The AI is based on the Q-learning algorithm. The AI is able to learn how to play the game by itself. The AI is also able to play the game automatically.
